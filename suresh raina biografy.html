	<p>Ms. Yang said she testified before the 2014 grand jury that indicted Mr. Hadden, and she also was among the women who sued Columbia University and the hospitals.

Mr. Hadden’s is one of several high-profile cases in recent years that involved sexual abuse of patients by doctors.

Last year, the University of Southern California agreed to pay more than $1.1 billion to the former patients of a campus gynecologist accused of preying sexually on hundreds of women.

That same year, more than 500 girls and women who had been abused by Lawrence G. Nassar, the former doctor for the national gymnastics team, reached a $380 million settlement with U.S.A. Gymnastics and the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee.</p>

	<p>They faced each other twice a month back, in the 2022 Asia Cup, and they are all set to face each other later this month in their 2022 T20 World Cup opener in Melbourne when Rohit Sharma-led India will aim to avenge their 10-wicket defeat in the last edition. And ahead of the blockbuster clash on October 23, former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar made a big statement comparing the two teams.</p>

	<p>While the prior version of the website had a side bar for navigation, the updated site features a top navigation bar with access to program resources, email preferences, membership details, code-level support, agreements, and events.

All of the same information can be accessed by simply scrolling down, and with most of what's needed right in program resources at the top, it should be quicker and easier for developers to find the tools that they're looking for.

Program resources includes App Store Connect information and one-click access to apps and analytics, plus it has software downloads and certificates, identifiers, and profiles for testing and distributing apps.</p>

	<p>New Delhi: The 140-strong Indian Army Wives Agitation Group dispatched an anguished letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday over the military’s continuance in operating vintage Cheetah and Chetak light utility helicopters (LUH), one of which crashed yet again earlier this week, killing its pilot and seriously injuring the co-pilot.

Lieutenant Colonel Saurabh Yadav, an experienced helicopter instructor died, while his co-pilot was hospitalised after their Cheetah (Aerospatiale SA-315B Lama) crashed near Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh on October 4. The cause of the accident is under investigation, but preliminary reports indicate engine failure in the legacy platform.


“Do the armed forces officers and their families not have the right to live in an India that provides safe flying machines to its (military) pilots to safeguard the nation?” asked the distressed Army Wives Agitation Group missive of the PM. It claimed that 31 military pilots had died, not by fighting the enemy, but in accidents involving both these helicopters since 2017, for no fault of theirs.

Can the PM, the letter further remonstrated, possibly safeguard the nation’s soldiers by making them operate these two six-decade-old helicopter types that first joined service in the early 1960s and had now become “flying coffins“, but still comprised the rotary-wing ‘backbone’ of the three services.

E-mailed by Meenal Wagh Bhosale, founder of the Group that included wives of mostly serving Army Aviation Corps (AAC) pilots and engineers responsible for operating and maintaining the outdated Cheetahs and Chetaks (Aerospatiale Alouette III), the letter further stated that in the 75th year of its independence, India was continuing to ‘sacrifice’ its soldiers by forcing them to operate antique and technically inefficient helicopters.

“There is no reason whatsoever for the AAC and the Indian Air Force (IAF) to continue operating these helicopters nearly 60 years after they were first inducted,” said Bhosale, the Nasik-based lawyer, who had also filed a legal petition in 2014 questioning the continuance of Cheetahs and Chetaks employed on disaster management missions and in high altitude areas like Siachen. She told The Wire that this was the first time that serving army officers’ wives had thus filed a petition “challenging the safety of India’s true heroes”.1.</p>
